## Privacy Policy for Sentiment Quorum

**Effective Date: July 25, 2025**

### 1. Introduction

Welcome to Sentiment Quorum, a service provided by Triton Lab, LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users ("you"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Sentiment Quorum SMS service (the "Service").

Please read this policy carefully. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### 2. Information We Collect

We adhere to a strict policy of data minimization. We only collect the information that is absolutely necessary to provide the Service:

* **Participant Mobile Phone Number:** We collect the phone numbers of individuals invited to a meeting poll by an organizer.
* **Meeting Information:** We collect basic details about the meeting, such as its title and scheduled time, as provided by the meeting organizer.

We do not collect any other personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, or location.

### 3. How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used exclusively for the following purposes:

* To send the initial sentiment poll via SMS to all designated participants.
* To receive and record your anonymous vote (`KEEP` or `CANCEL`).
* To send automated confirmation or clarification messages in response to your vote.
* To send a final notification to all participants once a decision quorum is reached or all votes are cast.

Your information is used for no other purpose.

### 4. Information Sharing and Disclosure

Your privacy is paramount. Our policy on sharing your information is simple and unambiguous.

> **We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information, including your mobile phone number, with any third parties for their marketing or promotional purposes.**

The only exception to this rule is if we are required to disclose information to comply with a legal obligation, such as a court order or subpoena.

### 5. Data Retention

We believe that personal data should not be stored indefinitely. In line with this principle:

**All personally identifiable information, including your phone number and associated vote data, is permanently deleted from our live systems shortly after the meeting poll is concluded and the final result has been communicated to all participants.**

### 6. Your Privacy Rights and Choices

You are in control of your participation in our Service.

* **Opt-Out:** You have the right to opt-out of our SMS communications at any time. To do so, simply reply **`STOP`** to any message you receive from our Service. You will receive one final message confirming your opt-out and will not be contacted again unless you are added to a new poll.
* **Help:** For assistance or information about the service, you can reply **`HELP`** to any message.

### 7. Data Security

We implement reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### 8. Children's Privacy

Our Service is not directed to or intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it immediately.

### 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
