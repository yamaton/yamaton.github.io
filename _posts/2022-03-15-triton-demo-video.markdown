Check out our demo video on Triton Notebook!

Here is how to set up this notebook environment on Visual Studio Code.

1. Open up [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Install if you don't have one. It's great for many purposes anyway.)

2. Install [Shell script command completion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tetradresearch.vscode-h2o) from the Marketplace. This is our extension enabling command autocompletion.

3. Go to `Help` â†’ `Show All Commands`.

4. Type and choose "Jupyter: Create New Jupyter Notebook".

5. Click "Python" at the bottom right corner of the box to change the cell language mode. Select "Shell Script".

6. Always type `%%bash` **at the first line of each cell** to enter command-line programs.
