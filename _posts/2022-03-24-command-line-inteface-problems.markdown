You see a door in front of you. You can tell it's a door because it has a knob. You can tell it opens and closes because of the knob and gaps between the wall. This is how you can distinguish a door from a wall.

There is no such thing as a knob in command-line interfaces. It's like you're surrounded by spheres and polygons and you have no idea how they work. Experts say RTFM (read the fxxking manual), but we have never read a manual of a door. There must be a better way.

This [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/1168/) beautifully depicts the situation. ([Here](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1168:_tar) is explanation if you don't get it.)

Libraries of programming languages are in a better position thanks to IDEs. IDEs provide autocomplete (aka. IntelliSense) with bite-sized descriptions. They also allow you to peek at definitions. The command-line interface desperately needs IDE-like features and more.

... to be cont'd.
