### 2. The Service: Sentiment Quorum

Sentiment Quorum is an SMS-based polling service that allows groups to anonymously and democratically vote on whether to keep or cancel a scheduled meeting. An organizer can create a meeting poll, and participants included by the organizer will receive SMS messages to cast their vote. The Service keeps individual votes confidential and only announces the final outcome to the group.

You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service.

### 3. SMS/Text Messaging Terms

Your use of the Service is conducted via SMS. By participating in a Sentiment Quorum poll, you consent to receive text messages from us.

* **Program Description:** The Sentiment Quorum service sends you SMS messages to invite you to polls for meetings you are a part of, confirm your votes, and notify you of the final outcome.

* **Message Frequency:** Message frequency varies depending on your participation in meeting polls. You will receive messages when a poll is initiated, when your vote is confirmed, if your vote requires clarification, and when a poll concludes.

* **Opt-Out:** You can opt-out of the SMS service at any time. Reply STOP to any message to unsubscribe. You will receive a one-time confirmation text, and then you will no longer receive messages from this service.
