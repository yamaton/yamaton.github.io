## Sentiment Quorum: Messaging and Consent Policy

**Last Updated: July 25, 2025**

At Triton Lab, LLC, transparency is a core value. This document explains how and why you might receive SMS (text) messages from our Sentiment Quorum service.

### Our Consent Model: Organizer-Initiated Messages

Sentiment Quorum does not send unsolicited marketing or promotional messages. Our service is a tool used by meeting organizers to conduct anonymous polls with a specific group of people (the participants).

Messages are only sent when a meeting organizer provides your mobile number as part of a specific meeting poll they have created. By providing your number, the organizer is affirming to us that they have your permission to contact you for matters related to that specific meeting. This is sometimes called an "implied consent" model.

### How Organizers Provide Consent

To ensure compliance and respect for all participants, we require every meeting organizer to explicitly confirm they have obtained consent before using our service. This is done in one of two ways:

#### 1. Using Our Web Form

When an organizer creates a poll using the web form on our website, they must check a mandatory, non-pre-checked box with the following statement:

> ☐ "I confirm that I have obtained prior consent from all participants listed above to receive SMS notifications from the Sentiment Quorum service regarding this specific meeting. I understand that replying **STOP** will opt them out and **Msg & Data rates may apply**."

The poll cannot be sent unless this box is checked.

#### 2. Using SMS to Create a Meeting

If an organizer creates a meeting by texting our service, our automated system will ask for their confirmation before sending any messages to participants. The prompt will be similar to:

> "Before I send the poll, please confirm you have permission from all participants to be contacted. Reply **YES** to proceed."

### What to Expect as a Participant

If a meeting organizer has included you in a Sentiment Quorum poll, the first message you receive will always clearly identify itself and provide you with immediate control. This message serves as your Call-to-Action.

It will look like this:

> "Sentiment Quorum poll for [Meeting Title]. Your vote is anonymous. Reply KEEP or CANCEL to vote. Reply **HELP** for help, **STOP** to opt-out. Msg&Data rates may apply. Msg frequency varies per meeting."

### Managing Your Messages: You Are in Control

You can control the messages you receive at any time.

* **To Opt-Out (Stop Messages):** Reply **`STOP`** to any message. You will receive one final confirmation message, and then you will be permanently opted-out from receiving messages from our service number.
* **To Get Help:** Reply **`HELP`** to any message for assistance or information.

### Service Disclosures

* **Program Description:** Sentiment Quorum sends anonymous SMS polls to meeting attendees to democratically decide if a scheduled meeting should be kept or canceled.
* **Message Frequency:** Message frequency is not fixed. It varies based on how many meeting polls you are included in by organizers.
* **Pricing:** **Message and data rates may apply.** Please consult your mobile carrier for details about your specific plan.
